# Cypress Automation Project

This project is a test automation suite built using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a modern JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework. It is designed to automate UI testing for web applications and includes sample test cases for demonstration purposes.

## Features
- Automated UI testing for web applications.
- Uses Cypress's powerful commands for DOM interaction and assertions.
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules`, videos, and screenshots.
- Easy to set up and run.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Cypress.

## Project Structure
- cypress/integration/: Contains test specifications.
- cypress/videos/: Stores video recordings of test runs (ignored in .gitignore).
- cypress/screenshots/: Stores screenshots captured during test failures (ignored in .gitignore).
- package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
